# 2. Create stack using a local terraform backend

Date: 2021-12-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide a backend to store terraform state files

## Decision

We will use a local backend. This is because we are not sure what backend Servian currently uses. This will make creating the deployment easier and quicker.

## Consequences

Multiple people can not work on the same terraform state. This may cause errors with multiple stacks with the same name
